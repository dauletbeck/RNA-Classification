05.04 -- created this repository to recreate the RNAprecis codebase for my purposes

13.04 -- finally organizing the clean mintage code

16.04 -- reconstructed mintage pipeline, still a few bugs with dimensionalities, most likely an input issue

21.04 -- mintage runs properly, fixed all input issues. Issues with plotting persist, but was able to reproduce afterwards.
