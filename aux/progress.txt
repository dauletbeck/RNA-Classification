05.04 -- created this repository to recreate the RNAprecis codebase for my purposes

13.04 -- finally organizing the clean mintage code

16.04 -- reconstructed mintage pipeline, still a few bugs with dimensionalities, most likely an input issue

21.04 -- mintage runs properly, fixed all input issues. Issues with plotting persist, but was able to reproduce afterwards.

29.04 -- using Franzisca's scripts to reproduce results, finally mintage runs. A couple of assessment steps and we're ready to start low-res classification

03.05 -- starting working with low res data, initial progress on rescaling variance for multicenter polysphere coordinates, derived scaling factors.

12.05 -- applying exponential map to distances, obtaining S^7
